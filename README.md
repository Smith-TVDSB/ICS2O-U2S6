# 2-6 Exercise 1
This example project is written in Python, and tested with pytest.

## The assignment
Edit the student.py file and make the functions work as intended.

### Exercise 1  
Make the Cowabunga function that outputs the word 'Cowabunga' as many times as the number passed into the function.

|Number   |Output       |
|---------|-------------|
|1        | Cowabunga   |
|2        |CowabungaCowabunga|
|3        |CowabungaCowabungaCowabunga|
etc.  





### Notes
- pip's install path is not included in the PATH var by default, so without installing via `sudo -H`, pytest would be unaccessible.
